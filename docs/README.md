# Alaria Dynamics - Jekyll site (docs/)

This folder contains a minimal Jekyll-based starter for the Alaria Dynamics website. It is intended to be served from GitHub Pages using the repository's `docs/` folder as the publishing source.

How to preview locally:

2. In `docs/`: run `bundle install` then `bundle exec jekyll serve --port 4000`.

GitHub Actions in this repo will build the site on push/PR.
